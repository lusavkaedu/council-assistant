This will help minimise the\nneed for a drawdown from reserves at year end, which would otherwise weaken the\nCouncil’s financial resilience. The impact on reserves can be seen in Section 7 of the\nreport.\n4 Other Factors\n4.1 Schools’ Delegated budgets are reporting an overspend of +£30.4m. This reflects the\nimpact of high demand for additional SEN support and greater demand for specialist\nprovision. In 2022-23, the Council entered the DfE’s Safety Valve Programme for those\nCouncils with the highest deficits to support the development of a sustainable plan for\nrecovery.",
