The strategic\nboard is well established and the recommendation implementation groups have been working for\nover two years. A new chair has been appointed from within the county and is working with the\nStrategic Board to develop an upd strategy. The priorities from this strategy are:\n• To secure a mechanism that creates joint ownership of knowledge and skills between\nproviders and employers in Kent and Medway\n• To create relevant and viable Level 3 provision across Kent and Medway that reflects\nregional skill needs, whilst providing meaningful choice, an outstanding learning experience\nand strong progression.\n• To ensure there is an offer that enable learners who have SEMH needs to reengage with\nmainstream provision and perform as well as those cohorts that do not.\n• To ensure there is an appropriate and local offer to enable learners who have SEND\nrequirement to increase their life choices and meet their full potential.\n• To increase the number of learners, including those with SEND, studying at Level 2 from a\nGCSE base of less than 2 (Level 1 entry criteria).\nAnother development is the establishment of Local Collaborative Partnership Areas (LCPAs),\nbringing together senior leaders in travel to learn areas across the county to plan a coherent offer\nat a local level.",

The cost of providing school places in response to\nhousing growth is significant, the County Council seeks developer contributions towards\nmitigating this cost. Developer contributions for education are secured either through Section\n106 (s106) agreements or through the Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL).\nS106 agreements are secured from housing developers at the time that planning permission is\ngranted, they are intended to ensure development proposals are acceptable in planning terms.\nWhen securing a s106 agreement KCC will outline the additional impact the development would\nhave on local schools, where we would need to add additional provision in response and the cost\n19",

    "text": "The overall number of pupils in Kent secondary schools has risen since 2014-15, from 77,931\npupils to 93,349 in 2023-24, an increase in excess of 19% over a nine-year period. This has\nbeen driven by larger Year 6 cohorts entering the secondary sector and demand generated by\nhousing development. We anticipate that the Year 7 rolls will continue to increase during the\nPlan Period. This level of need for Year 7 places will require significant further investment in the\nsecondary estate to maintain sufficiency of places and will continue to represent a major\nchallenge to the Council and its commissioning partners in the years to come.\nFigures 7d and 7e provide a breakdown of expected surplus or deficit capacity in Year 7 by non-\nselective and selective planning groups, across the 10-year period to 2033-33.",

In\n2025 forecasts show a deficit of -92 (3FE) places rising to a peak of -162 (5.4FE) in 2027/28.\nThe pressure showing in Sittingbourne is exacerbated by the numbers of pupils travelling off the\nIsle of Sheppey for their secondary education.

All areas have appointed a lead to drive the work in the area and have\nbegun setting priorities.\n10.1 The LCPAs and their Priorities\nDartford/Gravesham/Swanley\n• Develop comms between education providers, parents and young people.\n• Map and analyse the local post-16 offer.\n• Widen participation and developing effective pathways for all young people.\n• Pilot a more common approach to CEIAG across the area.\n• Develop SEN provision and level 1/Entry qualifications.\nWest Kent\n• Understand the context (Attainment, Provision, NEETs).\n• Build sufficient provision at all levels and for all need types.",

KCC has developed a system that combines these new-\nbuild pupil product rates (PPRs) with the stock housing PPR of the local area to model the\nimpact of new housing developments together with changing local demographics over time.\nThis information is shared with district authorities to inform longer term requirements for\neducation infrastructure and the Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) discussions at an early\nstage.\nForecasting future demand for school places can never be completely precise given the broad\nassumptions which have to be made about movements in and out of any given locality, the\npace of individual housing developments, patterns of occupation and not least parental\npreferences for places at individual schools.",
