    "text": "Mrs Chandler (Cabinet member for Integrated Children’s Services) introduced\nthe report on the transfer of statutory functions delivered by the 18-25 section\nof the Strengthening Independence Service (SIS) from the Children Young\nPeople and Education Directorate to the Adult Social Care and Health\nDirectorate from 1 April 2025. The transfer of the service was to align with\nlegal responsibilities, it did not impact on the level of service being provided by\nto those young people within that cohort. The council recognised the\nchallenges inherent to the transition from young people’s services to adult\nservices and was working on a larger initiative to ensure the process was\nmore coordinated and supportive. By addressing these needs earlier in the\nyoung people's lives, the council aimed to provide a smoother and more\nbeneficial transition, ultimately improving outcomes for these vulnerable\nindividuals and their families.\n2.",

The plan was a live\ndocument. Mr Love expressed his thanks to the Assistant Director of\nEducation, Mr Abrahams, and his officers.\n2. Mr Abrahams (Assistant Director Education) elaborated further and advised\nthat the document also touched upon other areas where the authority had\nstatutory responsibilities, such as the post-16 sector and early years\neducation, though these were not covered in as much detail.",
