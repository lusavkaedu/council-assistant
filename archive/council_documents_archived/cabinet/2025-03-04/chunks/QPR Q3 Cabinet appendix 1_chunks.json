While these numbers are\nimpressive, it is important to remember that there is no dedicated funding for land\nacquisition. We must engage with landowners to find space for every tree, each site\npresenting unique local and landscape challenges.\nWe made arrangements to partner with Gravesham Borough Council, Medway Council,\nThanet District Council, Tonbridge & Malling Borough Council, Dartford District Council,\nCanterbury City Council and Tunbridge Wells Borough Council to plant an additional\n13,500 trees in the new year (round 4 LATF).",
