    "text": "Responding to the White Paper\n4.1 The White Paper sets out a clear framework for delivering devolution and makes\nclear the Government’s expectations in terms of governance reforms necessary\nfor areas to access the devolution opportunities and at what pace. It is clear that\nKent and Medway has many natural and inherent advantages in terms of its\ngeography, economy, identity and public service boundaries that make it an\nobvious candi for the creation of a cohesive and ambitious Strategic\nAuthority. In meetings with Ministers they have encouraged an application to the\npriority programme from Kent and Medway.\n4.2 The immediate response required to the White Paper by the Government\nimposed deadline of 10 January 2025 is a decision on whether Kent should\nrequest to be on the Devolution Priority Programme and whether KCC should\nrequest that the council elections scheduled for May 2025 be postponed.\nPage 5",

You will receive\nunder separate cover a letter outlining the ambition and key elements of the White\nPaper, but I also wanted to write to areas which might be in scope for a joint\nprogramme of devolution and local government reorganisation, to set out a clear\nprocess and key milestones.\nThe Government’s long-term vision is for simpler structures which make it much\nclearer for residents who they should look to on local issues, with fewer politicians\nable to focus on delivering.",
