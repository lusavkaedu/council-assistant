This report set out the Council’s strategy for achieving both\nin-year and future year savings to assure a more sustainable financial position\nfor the Authority and set out new strategic objectives focused on putting the\nCouncil on a financially sustainable footing.\n3.2 As set out in the Budget Recovery Plan (Cabinet – October 2023), the financial\nchallenge cannot be overstated. Every decision the Council takes needs to be\nconsidered in terms of this fundamental policy priority.",
