Moving more services into Millmead would have had a bigger positive impact on\nthe most poverty-stricken area of Thanet. Families who are already struggling financially\nwill now have to pay for travel to get to services that once would have cost them nothing.\nYou will be adding to the financial strain of families already struggling to meet day to day\ncosts.”\n“This area is very deprived, and the service users have taken a long time to grow confident\nin their children’s centre and its workers, this change which obviously saves money will\nknock that confidence and once again they will feel like they don’t matter.”\n“Millmead children’s centre was created by the families in Millmead for the families in\nMillmead.",
