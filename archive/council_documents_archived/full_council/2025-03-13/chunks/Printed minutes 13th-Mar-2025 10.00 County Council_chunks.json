    "text": "Substantive motion carried.\n6. RESOLVED that:\nThis Council believes that:\na) Immediate and decisive action is needed to address the environmental\nand public health risks posed by disposable vapes, rather than\ndelaying with prolonged studies, and welcomes news that from 1 June\n2025 it will be illegal to sell single-use (disposable) vapes under The\nEnvironmental Protection (Single-use Vapes) (England) Regulations\n2024.\nb) Any ban must be robust and comprehensive, preventing\nmanufacturers from exploiting legal loopholes to continue selling\nharmful products.\nc) Stronger regulations on vape marketing, packaging, and accessibility\nto young people should be introduced alongside the ban.\nd) Urgent action is required to address the environmental and health\nimpacts of disposable vapes.\nAnd;\nThis Council agrees to call on the Cabinet Member for Adult Social Care\nand Public Health and Cabinet Member for Community and Regulatory\nServices to:\na) Write again to the government, urging swift and decisive action to\nclose identified loopholes on disposable vapes, and supporting calls\nfor amendments to the proposed legislation that limit refit tank sizes\nand close other loopholes that could undermine the ban.\nb) Encourage proper disposal of vapes and promote responsible\nrecycling initiatives.",
