You will already be aware that we have undertaken significant engagement with District\nand Borough Council Leaders given the time available over the Christmas and New Year period,\nas well as briefing Kent & Medway MPs and other key stakeholders.\nWe are confident that Kent and Medway can meet the timetable set out by the Government for\nlocal areas on the Devolution Priority Programme to create the Mayoral Strategic Authority (MSA)\nand hold the first Mayoral election in May 2026.\nWhilst there is some mixed feeling from District and Borough Council Leaders about the speed of\nmoving forward with devolution on this timetable, and a desire to ensure that the period in which\nthe structure of the new Strategic Authority (SA) will be a Mayoral County Combined Authority\n(MCCA) prior to the completion of local government reorganisation is minimised, there is also\ngeneral acceptance of the clear direction and expectation on devolution that has been set out by\nthe Government.\nPage 1 of 2",
