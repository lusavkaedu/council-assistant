Many end up in landfill\nor as litter, contributing to pollution.\nAn estimated 8 million disposable vapes are thrown away each week in the UK,\nequivalent to the lithium batteries of 5,000 electric vehicles annually. The improper\ndisposal of disposable vapes leads to dangerous chemicals entering the\nenvironment, soil pollution, and increased fire risks in waste management facilities.\nThere is growing concern about the social and health impact of disposable vapes,\nparticularly among young people, with evidence showing their appeal due to bright\npackaging and sweet flavours.\nThe government has proposed a ban on disposable vapes but the introduction of\nnew ‘Big Puff’ devices are designed to avoid the imminent legislation which now\nrequires amendment.\nThe Conservatives' own Shadow Health Secretary has called for amendments to\nlimit the size of refill tanks and close other loopholes in the proposed ban.\nMotion:\nThis Council believes that:\na.) Immediate and decisive action is needed to address the environmental and\npublic health risks posed by disposable vapes, rather than delaying with\nprolonged studies.\nb.) Any ban must be robust and comprehensive, preventing manufacturers from\nexploiting legal loopholes to continue selling harmful products.\nc.) Stronger regulations on vape marketing, packaging, and accessibility to young\npeople should be introduced alongside the ban.\nd.) Urgent action is required to address the environmental and health impacts of\ndisposable vapes.\nAnd;",
