These are sourced from the three main river valleys of the\nDarent, Medway and Stour, and the beach deposits along the coast (particularly at\nDungeness). As far back as 1970, planning studies39 identified concerns about the\ndepletion of flint gravels in the river valleys and the constraints on availability of the\ncoastal supply in the Dungeness area due to nature conservation and water\nresource protection.",

Minerals are a finite natural resource which need to be used prudently.\nThe purpose of safeguarding minerals is to ensure that sufficient economic minerals\nare available for future generations to use. The viability of extracting resources may\nchange over time and is likely to increase as resources become more scarce.\nMineral transportation infrastructure is also important because, as described in\nsection 5.2, imported minerals make a major contribution to the County's\nrequirements and production facilities convert materials into useable products.

Further guidance on the\nimplementation of this policy is included in a Supplementary Planning Document\nand any of its future revisions.\nPolicy DM 8\nSafeguarding Minerals Management, Transportation Production & Waste\nManagement Facilities\nPlanning permission will only be granted for development that is incompatible with\nsafeguarded minerals management, transportation or waste management facilities,",
