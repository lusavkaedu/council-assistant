    "text": "There are also drawdowns from reserves (-£10.6m) and the removal of Prior Year\nDrawdown and Contributions (-£19.7m), but overall there is still a net increase in\ncontribution to reserves to improve the overall financial resilience of the Authority.\nAs a result of the above, I have also undertaken a risk analysis of the adequacy of\nfinancial reserves, taking account the financial risks above. This resolution makes\nprovision for this level of reserves. I am therefore of the view that this budget does\nprovide for an adequate level of reserves.\nConclusions\nThe external auditor’s latest assessment of the arrangements in place to assure\nvalue for money highlighted considerable improvements that have already been\nimplemented in improving economy, efficiency and effectiveness, whilst noting that\nthe Council needs to focus on the drivers of its forecast overspends (including High\nNeeds spend), if it is to protect its reserves position in future years.",
