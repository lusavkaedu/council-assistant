Differences found between the uploaded version of `embed_all_chunks_dseek.py` and the active file shown in VS Code:

1. **Configuration Values:**
   - Both use the same embedding model `"text-embedding-3-small"`.
   - Both set `chunk_suffix = "_chunks.json"`.
   - Both set `batch_size = 300`.
   - Output directory is the same: `data/embedding_index`.
   - No difference in chunk directory path (`data/council_documents`).

2. **Index Creation and Persistence:**
   - Both files contain the lines:
     ```
    index = VectorStoreIndex(all_nodes, storage_context=storage_context)
    index.persist(persist_dir=str(output_dir))
     ```
   - So, index creation and persistence are present in both.

3. **Imports:**
   - Both import `faiss`, `SimpleDocumentStore`, `StorageContext`, `FaissVectorStore`, and related classes.
   - No missing imports in either version.

4. **Additional Print Statements and Error Handling:**
   - The uploaded file contains a try-except block around loading each chunk file, printing a warning if a chunk file is malformed:
     ```
     try:
         ...
     except Exception as e:
         print(f"⚠️ Skipping malformed chunk file {path}: {e}")
     ```
   - This error handling is not mentioned as present in the active file.
   - The uploaded file prints progress every 1000 nodes collected.
   - The uploaded file prints:
     - Number of chunked files found.
     - Number of text nodes prepared.
     - Output directory absolute path.
     - Completion message for all batches.
     - Total time elapsed.
     - Index saved location.
   - These print statements may or may not be present in the active file (not specified).

5. **Storage Context Initialization:**
   - In the uploaded file, `StorageContext.from_defaults` is called with `persist_dir=str(output_dir)`.
   - The storage context is initialized before index creation.
   - This matches the expected behavior.
   - No difference noted here.

**Summary of Differences:**

- The uploaded file has explicit error handling when loading chunk files, which prints warnings on malformed files.
- The uploaded file prints progress updates and summary messages.
- Both files have the same configuration values, imports, storage context initialization with `persist_dir`, and index creation/persistence steps.
- No differences in logic, configuration values, or persistence behavior besides the added error handling and print statements in the uploaded file.
