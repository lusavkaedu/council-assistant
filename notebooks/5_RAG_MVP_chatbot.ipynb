    "The most contentious issues during the 2025 budget debates included:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Reliance on One-off Measures**: The 2025-26 draft budget continued to rely on one-off financial solutions, which was a point of concern as it indicated a lack of sustainable, long-term financial planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Unfunded Spending Growth**: There was significant spending growth that exceeded the forecasted funding, necessitating the need for additional savings and income to balance the budget. This included spending on pay increases and other non-inflationary cost factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Insufficient Government Funding**: The administration highlighted that the multi-year settlements from the government had not been announced, which added uncertainty to the financial planning process.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Net Zero Funding and Environmental Commitments**: There were concerns about the affordability of funding for Net Zero requirements, with potential implications for the council's ability to meet environmental targets.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Waste Management Financial Pressures**: The volatility in income from waste management due to market conditions and increased gate fees led to unfunded pressures on the revenue budget.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Capital Works and Infrastructure Risks**: Significant risks were associated with capital works, such as the collapse of the Galley Hill cliff, which required costly remedial measures that the council might need to fund.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Special Educational Needs and Disabilities (SEND) Costs**: There were ongoing financial pressures from increased costs associated with Education & Health Care Plans (EHCP) and home-to-school transport for SEND students.\n",
    "\n",
    "These issues collectively highlighted the challenges of balancing the need for essential public services against the backdrop of limited funding and rising costs.\n",

    "model 4o-mini (10,2)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The most contentious issues during the budget debates in 2025 included significant spending growth, particularly in Adult Social Care, which accounted for £80 million of a total £150 million increase. Despite this growth, the council faced a shortfall of over £60 million in required savings/income for 2025-2026, compounded by insufficient government funding that only provided a net increase of £30 million. Additionally, the council's decision to raise council tax by 2.99% plus an additional 2% for the social care premium was contentious, as it highlighted the pressure to make further savings and the impact on discretionary services. The lack of government support for areas like Kent, which do not have high levels of deprivation, further exacerbated the situation, leading to concerns about the sustainability of funding for essential services.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The most contentious issues during the budget debates in 2025 included significant spending growth that continued to exceed forecast funding, necessitating savings and income to balance the budget. Key factors contributing to this contentiousness were the reliance on one-off funding, the impact of inflation on costs, particularly in waste management, and the need for compensating in-year savings due to unfunded pressures. Additionally, the uncertainty surrounding multi-year settlements from the government added to the complexity of the budget discussions.\n",
    "\n",
    "model 4o-mini, (20,1)\n",
    "\n",
    "The most contentious issues during the budget debates in 2025 included the significant spending growth that exceeded forecast funding, which necessitated savings and income to balance the budget. Specifically, there was a forecast spending growth of £150 million, with £80 million allocated to Adult Social Care, while the council faced a requirement for over £60 million in net savings/income for 2025-2026, in addition to the £90 million saved for 2024-25. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another contentious point was the insufficient net growth in funding from the government, which amounted to only £30 million, failing to cover the anticipated spending growth. This led to plans for a council tax increase of 2.99% plus an additional 2% for the social care premium, which was met with concerns about the impact on residents. Additionally, there were discussions regarding the allocation of government grants, as the council did not receive a new recovery grant intended for areas with high deprivation, which further highlighted the financial pressures faced by the council."
