    "This notebook is designed to process and clean up the committee list. This is an essential step before we start scraping meetings and matching them to the correct committee names.\n",

    "### 🧭 Workflow Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Download the raw HTML file**  \n",
    "   - Go to the council’s meetings page (e.g. *Browse Meetings*).\n",
    "   - Save the full HTML of the committee list (often includes both active and historic entries).\n",
    "   - https://democracy.kent.gov.uk:9071/ieDocHome.aspx?XXR=0&Year=-1&Page=1&Categories=-14759&EB=F& - example\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Parse the HTML and extract committee entries**  \n",
    "   - Use BeautifulSoup to extract all `<li>` elements inside the main `<div class=\"mgList\">`.\n",
    "   - Extract each committee name and check if the text includes a phrase like `decommissioned DD/MM/YYYY`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Build a raw committee dataframe**  \n",
    "   - For each committee, extract:\n",
    "     - `canonical_name` (the visible name)\n",
    "     - `committee_id` (slugified name)\n",
    "     - `status`: `active` or `inactive` (based on presence of `decommissioned`)\n",
    "     - `date_inactivated`: if applicable\n",
    "     - `council_code`: e.g. `\"kent_cc\"`\n",
    "     - `aliases`: initially empty list\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Search and alias-mapping**  \n",
    "   - Define keywords (e.g. `\"social care\"`, `\"children\"`) to explore historical committee variants.\n",
    "   - Use `search_committees_by_keyword()` to inspect all matching entries.\n",
    "   - Use `auto_map_aliases_by_keyword()` to map **inactive** committee names to a **single active** canonical one.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Manually discard irrelevant committees**  \n",
    "   - Define terms (e.g. `\"forum\"`, `\"local\"`, `\"Maidstone\"`) for committees that should be removed entirely.\n",
    "   - Use `committees_df` and `inactive_committees` to prune out these entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Maintain an alias map**  \n",
    "   - Store alias relationships in a central `alias_map_df`.\n",
    "   - Append to `../data/references/committee_alias_map.csv` for persistence.\n",
    "   - Ensure removed committees are no longer in the final list.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Inject aliases into canonical records**  \n",
    "   - Populate each active committee’s `aliases` list based on the reverse lookup from `alias_map_df`.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Save the cleaned, structured output**  \n",
    "   - Export the final `committees_df` as a JSONL file for downstream use:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     ../data/metadata/committees.jsonl\n",
    "     ../data/references/committee_alias_map.csv\n",
    "     ```"
