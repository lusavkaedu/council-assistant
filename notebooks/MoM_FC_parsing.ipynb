       "      <td>(4) Mr Oakford proposed and Mr Gough Seconded the following motion: “County Council, having given due regard to the s25 Report (published for consideration as agenda item 5 of this meeting), is asked to agree the following: 2025-35 Capital Programme (a) The 10-year Capital programme and investment proposals of £1,419m over the years from 2025-26 to 2034-35 together with the necessary funding and subject to approval to spend arrangements. (b) The directorate capital programmes as set out in appendices A &amp; B of the final draft budget report published on 5th February 2025. 2025-26 Revenue Budget and Medium Term Financial Plan (c) The net revenue budget requirement of £1,530.9m for 2025-26. (d) The directorate revenue budget proposals for 2025-26 and the medium term financial plan as set out in appendices D (high level county 3 year plan) E (high level 2025-26 plan by directorate), appendix F (individual spending, savings, income and reserves variations for 2025-26) and G (2025-26 key services) of the final draft budget report published on 5th February 2025. 2025-26 Council Tax (e) To increase Council Tax band rates up to the maximum permitted without a referendum as set out in section 6.4 (table 6.1) of the final draft report published on 5th February 2025. (f) The total Council Tax requirement of £994,287,655 to be raised through precepts on districts as set out in section 6.6 (table 6.2) in the final draft report published on 5th February 2025. Kent Pay Scheme 2025-26 (g) Note the transition of all Kent Scheme staff to the new pay structure agreed by County Council in May 2024 (h) Agree to the recommendations on the uplift to Kent Pay Scheme as set out in section 7.9 of the final draft budget published on 5th February 2025 Key Policies and Strategies (i) Fees and charges to continue to be reviewed in line with the policy agreed in the 2023-24 budget approval (j) The Capital Strategy as set out in appendix O of the final draft report published on 5th February 2025 including the Prudential Indicators. (k) The Treasury Management Strategy as set out in appendix M of the final draft report published on 5th February 2025 (l) The Minimum Revenue Provision (MRP) Statement as set out in appendix P of the final draft report published on 5th February 2025 (m) The Flexible Use of Capital Receipts Strategy as set out in appendix Q of the final draft report published on 5th February 2025. (n) The Reserves Policy as set out in appendix H of the final draft budget report published on 5th February 2025. In addition: (o) To delegate authority to the Chief Executive, in consultation with the Leader of the Council and the Cabinet Member for Finance, Corporate and Traded Services, to agree any other non-pay related changes to the Kent Scheme through the conclusion of pay bargaining. (p) To delegate authority to the Corporate Director of Finance (after consultation with the Leader, the Deputy Leader and Cabinet Member for Finance, Corporate &amp; Traded Services and the political Group Leaders) to resolve any minor technical issues and structural changes for the final budget publication which do not materially alter the approved budget or change the net budget requirement and for any changes made to be reflected in the final version of the Budget Book (blue combed) due to be published in March 2025. (q) To note the information on the impact of the County Council’s share of retained business rates, business rate pool and business rate collection fund balances on the revenue budget will be reported to Cabinet once it has all been received. (r) To note the ongoing and escalating cost pressures on the Council’s budget alongside insufficient funding in the local government finance settlement and knock on requirement for savings and income in the final draft 2025-26 budget and medium term financial plan. (s) To note potential changes to local authority funding system from 2026- 27 onwards and consequential uncertain financial outlook for later years until a multi-year settlement from government is reintroduced. (t) To note that fundamental changes to social care are unlikely until after Baroness Casey enquiry concludes. (u) To note that the planned use of reserves still ensures sufficient reserves are available in the short term with no immediate concerns triggering a S114 notice provided the use of these reserves is replaced with sustainable savings over the medium term. (v) To note the rate of recent drawdown from reserves and potential drawdown to balance 2024-25 outturn is still cause for serious concern and reserves will still need to be maintained ahead of changes under Devolution White Paper. Further unplanned drawdowns would weaken resilience and should only be considered as a last resort with an agreed strategy to replenish reserves at earliest opportunity.”</td>\n",

       "0  (4) Mr Oakford proposed and Mr Gough Seconded the following motion: “County Council, having given due regard to the s25 Report (published for consideration as agenda item 5 of this meeting), is asked to agree the following: 2025-35 Capital Programme (a) The 10-year Capital programme and investment proposals of £1,419m over the years from 2025-26 to 2034-35 together with the necessary funding and subject to approval to spend arrangements. (b) The directorate capital programmes as set out in appendices A & B of the final draft budget report published on 5th February 2025. 2025-26 Revenue Budget and Medium Term Financial Plan (c) The net revenue budget requirement of £1,530.9m for 2025-26. (d) The directorate revenue budget proposals for 2025-26 and the medium term financial plan as set out in appendices D (high level county 3 year plan) E (high level 2025-26 plan by directorate), appendix F (individual spending, savings, income and reserves variations for 2025-26) and G (2025-26 key services) of the final draft budget report published on 5th February 2025. 2025-26 Council Tax (e) To increase Council Tax band rates up to the maximum permitted without a referendum as set out in section 6.4 (table 6.1) of the final draft report published on 5th February 2025. (f) The total Council Tax requirement of £994,287,655 to be raised through precepts on districts as set out in section 6.6 (table 6.2) in the final draft report published on 5th February 2025. Kent Pay Scheme 2025-26 (g) Note the transition of all Kent Scheme staff to the new pay structure agreed by County Council in May 2024 (h) Agree to the recommendations on the uplift to Kent Pay Scheme as set out in section 7.9 of the final draft budget published on 5th February 2025 Key Policies and Strategies (i) Fees and charges to continue to be reviewed in line with the policy agreed in the 2023-24 budget approval (j) The Capital Strategy as set out in appendix O of the final draft report published on 5th February 2025 including the Prudential Indicators. (k) The Treasury Management Strategy as set out in appendix M of the final draft report published on 5th February 2025 (l) The Minimum Revenue Provision (MRP) Statement as set out in appendix P of the final draft report published on 5th February 2025 (m) The Flexible Use of Capital Receipts Strategy as set out in appendix Q of the final draft report published on 5th February 2025. (n) The Reserves Policy as set out in appendix H of the final draft budget report published on 5th February 2025. In addition: (o) To delegate authority to the Chief Executive, in consultation with the Leader of the Council and the Cabinet Member for Finance, Corporate and Traded Services, to agree any other non-pay related changes to the Kent Scheme through the conclusion of pay bargaining. (p) To delegate authority to the Corporate Director of Finance (after consultation with the Leader, the Deputy Leader and Cabinet Member for Finance, Corporate & Traded Services and the political Group Leaders) to resolve any minor technical issues and structural changes for the final budget publication which do not materially alter the approved budget or change the net budget requirement and for any changes made to be reflected in the final version of the Budget Book (blue combed) due to be published in March 2025. (q) To note the information on the impact of the County Council’s share of retained business rates, business rate pool and business rate collection fund balances on the revenue budget will be reported to Cabinet once it has all been received. (r) To note the ongoing and escalating cost pressures on the Council’s budget alongside insufficient funding in the local government finance settlement and knock on requirement for savings and income in the final draft 2025-26 budget and medium term financial plan. (s) To note potential changes to local authority funding system from 2026- 27 onwards and consequential uncertain financial outlook for later years until a multi-year settlement from government is reintroduced. (t) To note that fundamental changes to social care are unlikely until after Baroness Casey enquiry concludes. (u) To note that the planned use of reserves still ensures sufficient reserves are available in the short term with no immediate concerns triggering a S114 notice provided the use of these reserves is replaced with sustainable savings over the medium term.

(b) The directorate capital programmes as set out in appendices A &amp; B of the final draft budget report published on 5th February 2025. 2025-26 Revenue Budget and Medium Term Financial Plan (c) The net revenue budget requirement of £1,530.9m for 2025-26. (d) The directorate revenue budget proposals for 2025-26 and the medium term financial plan as set out in appendices D (high level county 3 year plan) E (high level 2025-26 plan by directorate), appendix F (individual spending, savings, income and reserves variations for 2025-26) and G (2025-26 key services) of the final draft budget report published on 5th February 2025. 2025-26 Council Tax (e) To increase Council Tax band rates up to the maximum permitted without a referendum as set out in section 6.4 (table 6.1) of the final draft report published on 5th February 2025. (f) The total Council Tax requirement of £994,287,655 to be raised through precepts on districts as set out in section 6.6 (table 6.2) in the final draft report published on 5th February 2025. Kent Pay Scheme 2025-26 (g) Note the transition of all Kent Scheme staff to the new pay structure agreed by County Council in May 2024 (h) Agree to the recommendations on the uplift to Kent Pay Scheme as set out in section 7.9 of the final draft budget published on 5th February 2025 Key Policies and Strategies (i) Fees and charges to continue to be reviewed in line with the policy agreed in the 2023-24 budget approval (j) The Capital Strategy as set out in appendix O of the final draft report published on 5th February 2025 including the Prudential Indicators. (k) The Treasury Management Strategy as set out in appendix M of the final draft report published on 5th February 2025 (l) The Minimum Revenue Provision (MRP) Statement as set out in appendix P of the final draft report published on 5th February 2025 (m) The Flexible Use of Capital Receipts Strategy as set out in appendix Q of the final draft report published on 5th February 2025. (n) The Reserves Policy as set out in appendix H of the final draft budget report published on 5th February 2025. In addition: (o) To delegate authority to the Chief Executive, in consultation with the Leader of the Council and the Cabinet Member for Finance, Corporate and Traded Services, to agree any other non-pay related changes to the Kent Scheme through the conclusion of pay bargaining. (p) To delegate authority to the Corporate Director of Finance (after consultation with the Leader, the Deputy Leader and Cabinet Member for Finance, Corporate &amp; Traded Services and the political Group Leaders) to resolve any minor technical issues and structural changes for the final budget publication which do not materially alter the approved budget or change the net budget requirement and for any changes made to be reflected in the final version of the Budget Book (blue combed) due to be published in March 2025. (q) To note the information on the impact of the County Council’s share of retained business rates, business rate pool and business rate collection fund balances on the revenue budget will be reported to Cabinet once it has all been received. (r) To note the ongoing and escalating cost pressures on the Council’s budget alongside insufficient funding in the local government finance settlement and knock on requirement for savings and income in the final draft 2025-26 budget and medium term financial plan. (s) To note potential changes to local authority funding system from 2026- 27 onwards and consequential uncertain financial outlook for later years until a multi-year settlement from government is reintroduced. (t) To note that fundamental changes to social care are unlikely until after Baroness Casey enquiry concludes. (u) To note that the planned use of reserves still ensures sufficient reserves are available in the short term with no immediate concerns triggering a S114 notice provided the use of these reserves is replaced with sustainable savings over the medium term. (v) To note the rate of recent drawdown from reserves and potential drawdown to balance 2024-25 outturn is still cause for serious concern and reserves will still need to be maintained ahead of changes under Devolution White Paper. Further unplanned drawdowns would weaken resilience and should only be considered as a last resort with an agreed strategy to replenish reserves at earliest opportunity.”</td>\n",

(r) To note the ongoing and escalating cost pressures on the Council’s budget alongside insufficient funding in the local government finance settlement and knock on requirement for savings and income in the final draft 2025-26 budget and medium term financial plan. (s) To note potential changes to local authority funding system from 2026- 27 onwards and consequential uncertain financial outlook for later years until a multi-year settlement from government is reintroduced. (t) To note that fundamental changes to social care are unlikely until after Baroness Casey enquiry concludes. (u) To note that the planned use of reserves still ensures sufficient reserves are available in the short term with no immediate concerns triggering a S114 notice provided the use of these reserves is replaced with sustainable savings over the medium term. (v) To note the rate of recent drawdown from reserves and potential drawdown to balance 2024-25 outturn is still cause for serious concern and reserves will still need to be maintained ahead of changes under Devolution White Paper. Further unplanned drawdowns would weaken resilience and should only be considered as a last resort with an agreed strategy to replenish reserves at earliest opportunity.</td>\n",

       "11  This amendment seeks to reduce the amount of capital allocated to the Strategic Estate Programme and allocate to the Local Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (LEVI) capital project. With the future of KCC uncertain, we believe that other than any urgent repair works, no further capital should be spent on the Invicta House refurbishment. With the proposed restructure to local government, a new unitary authority may decide not to include Invicta House as part of its strategic estate. We believe this funding should be used on important assets needed by residents right now rather than for investment in buildings KCC may not require in the future. With the looming ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel vehicles, many Kent residents will be making the switch to electric vehicles. However, not every resident has access to their own driveway or garage and park their cars on the street. The amendment proposes to ‘top-up’ the LEVI grant so that more Kent residents benefit from additional EV charging infrastructure.   \n",

For Districts clearing up the mess is difficult, time consuming and expensive stretching our budgets further and with very low levels of prosecution there is no effective deterrent.

       "0   (4) Mr Oakford proposed and Mr Gough Seconded the following motion: “County Council, having given due regard to the s25 Report (published for consideration as agenda item 5 of this meeting), is asked to agree the following: 2025-35 Capital Programme (a) The 10-year Capital programme and investment proposals of £1,419m over the years from 2025-26 to 2034-35 together with the necessary funding and subject to approval to spend arrangements. (b) The directorate capital programmes as set out in appendices A & B of the final draft budget report published on 5th February 2025. 2025-26 Revenue Budget and Medium Term Financial Plan (c) The net revenue budget requirement of £1,530.9m for 2025-26. (d) The directorate revenue budget proposals for 2025-26 and the medium term financial plan as set out in appendices D (high level county 3 year plan) E (high level 2025-26 plan by directorate), appendix F (individual spending, savings, income and reserves variations for 2025-26) and G (2025-26 key services) of the final draft budget report published on 5th February 2025. 2025-26 Council Tax (e) To increase Council Tax band rates up to the maximum permitted without a referendum as set out in section 6.4 (table 6.1) of the final draft report published on 5th February 2025. (f) The total Council Tax requirement of £994,287,655 to be raised through precepts on districts as set out in section 6.6 (table 6.2) in the final draft report published on 5th February 2025. Kent Pay Scheme 2025-26 (g) Note the transition of all Kent Scheme staff to the new pay structure agreed by County Council in May 2024 (h) Agree to the recommendations on the uplift to Kent Pay Scheme as set out in section 7.9 of the final draft budget published on 5th February 2025 Key Policies and Strategies (i) Fees and charges to continue to be reviewed in line with the policy agreed in the 2023-24 budget approval (j) The Capital Strategy as set out in appendix O of the final draft report published on 5th February 2025 including the Prudential Indicators. (k) The Treasury Management Strategy as set out in appendix M of the final draft report published on 5th February 2025 (l) The Minimum Revenue Provision (MRP) Statement as set out in appendix P of the final draft report published on 5th February 2025 (m) The Flexible Use of Capital Receipts Strategy as set out in appendix Q of the final draft report published on 5th February 2025. (n) The Reserves Policy as set out in appendix H of the final draft budget report published on 5th February 2025. In addition: (o) To delegate authority to the Chief Executive, in consultation with the Leader of the Council and the Cabinet Member for Finance, Corporate and Traded Services, to agree any other non-pay related changes to the Kent Scheme through the conclusion of pay bargaining. (p) To delegate authority to the Corporate Director of Finance (after consultation with the Leader, the Deputy Leader and Cabinet Member for Finance, Corporate & Traded Services and the political Group Leaders) to resolve any minor technical issues and structural changes for the final budget publication which do not materially alter the approved budget or change the net budget requirement and for any changes made to be reflected in the final version of the Budget Book (blue combed) due to be published in March 2025. (q) To note the information on the impact of the County Council’s share of retained business rates, business rate pool and business rate collection fund balances on the revenue budget will be reported to Cabinet once it has all been received. (r) To note the ongoing and escalating cost pressures on the Council’s budget alongside insufficient funding in the local government finance settlement and knock on requirement for savings and income in the final draft 2025-26 budget and medium term financial plan. (s) To note potential changes to local authority funding system from 2026- 27 onwards and consequential uncertain financial outlook for later years until a multi-year settlement from government is reintroduced. (t) To note that fundamental changes to social care are unlikely until after Baroness Casey enquiry concludes. (u) To note that the planned use of reserves still ensures sufficient reserves are available in the short term with no immediate concerns triggering a S114 notice provided the use of these reserves is replaced with sustainable savings over the medium term.

With the future of KCC uncertain, we believe that other than any urgent repair works, no further capital should be spent on the Invicta House refurbishment. With the proposed restructure to local government, a new unitary authority may decide not to include Invicta House as part of its strategic estate. We believe this funding should be used on important assets needed by residents right now rather than for investment in buildings KCC may not require in the future. With the looming ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel vehicles, many Kent residents will be making the switch to electric vehicles. However, not every resident has access to their own driveway or garage and park their cars on the street. The amendment proposes to ‘top-up’ the LEVI grant so that more Kent residents benefit from additional EV charging infrastructure.” Proposed Amount: “£2.149m to ‘top-up’ the LEVI capital project funding.” Proposed Funding Source: “Cancelling the reconfiguration of the 3rd and 4th floor of Invicta House, including provision of Member and CMT spaces.”  \n",

With the future of KCC uncertain, we believe that other than any urgent repair works, no further capital should be spent on the Invicta House refurbishment. With the proposed restructure to local government, a new unitary authority may decide not to include Invicta House as part of its strategic estate. We believe this funding should be used on important assets needed by residents right now rather than for investment in buildings KCC may not require in the future. Potholes and poorly maintained roads continue to inconvenience Kent’s Road users.

For Districts clearing up the mess is difficult, time consuming and expensive stretching our budgets further and with very low levels of prosecution there is no effective deterrent. It is proposed provide additional funds to Districts including but not limited to strategically placed movable ANPR Cameras located in the vicinity of fly tipping hot spots which will aid the work of District staff who are working to reduce this disgusting treatment of our environment.” Proposed Amount: “£1m” Proposed Funding Source: “Reduce the £12m waste reserve to £11m and use this un[1]ringfenced EPR income to fund these ANPR Cameras.”  \n",

       "27                                                    (27) RESOLVED that: County Council, having given due regard to the s25 Report (published for consideration as agenda item 5 of this meeting), is asked to agree the following: 2025-35 Capital Programme (a) The 10-year Capital programme and investment proposals of £1,419m over the years from 2025-26 to 2034-35 together with the necessary funding and subject to approval to spend arrangements. (b) The directorate capital programmes as set out in appendices A & B of the final draft budget report published on 5th February 2025. 2025-26 Revenue Budget and Medium Term Financial Plan (c) The net revenue budget requirement of £1,530.9m for 2025-26. (d) The directorate revenue budget proposals for 2025-26 and the medium term financial plan as set out in appendices D (high level county 3 year plan) E (high level 2025-26 plan by directorate), appendix F (individual spending, savings, income and reserves variations for 2025-26) and G (2025-26 key services) of the final draft budget report published on 5th February 2025. 2025-26 Council Tax (e) To increase Council Tax band rates up to the maximum permitted without a referendum as set out in section 6.4 (table 6.1) of the final draft report published on 5th February 2025. (f) The total Council Tax requirement of £994,287,655 to be raised through precepts on districts as set out in section 6.6 (table 6.2) in the final draft report published on 5th February 2025. Kent Pay Scheme 2025-26 (g) Note the transition of all Kent Scheme staff to the new pay structure agreed by County Council in May 2024 (h) Agree to the recommendations on the uplift to Kent Pay Scheme as set out in section 7.9 of the final draft budget published on 5th February 2025 Key Policies and Strategies (i) Fees and charges to continue to be reviewed in line with the policy agreed in the 2023-24 budget approval (j) The Capital Strategy as set out in appendix O of the final draft report published on 5th February 2025 including the Prudential Indicators. (k) The Treasury Management Strategy as set out in appendix M of the final draft report published on 5th February 2025 (l) The Minimum Revenue Provision (MRP) Statement as set out in appendix P of the final draft report published on 5th February 2025 (m) The Flexible Use of Capital Receipts Strategy as set out in appendix Q of the final draft report published on 5th February 2025. (n) The Reserves Policy as set out in appendix H of the final draft budget report published on 5th February 2025. In addition: (o) To delegate authority to the Chief Executive, in consultation with the Leader of the Council and the Cabinet Member for Finance, Corporate and Traded Services, to agree any other non-pay related changes to the Kent Scheme through the conclusion of pay bargaining. (p) To delegate authority to the Corporate Director of Finance (after consultation with the Leader, the Deputy Leader and Cabinet Member for Finance, Corporate & Traded Services and the political Group Leaders) to resolve any minor technical issues and structural changes for the final budget publication which do not materially alter the approved budget or change the net budget requirement and for any changes made to be reflected in the final version of the Budget Book (blue combed) due to be published in March 2025. (q) To note the information on the impact of the County Council’s share of retained business rates, business rate pool and business rate collection fund balances on the revenue budget will be reported to Cabinet once it has all been received. (r) To note the ongoing and escalating cost pressures on the Council’s budget alongside insufficient funding in the local government finance settlement and knock on requirement for savings and income in the final draft 2025-26 budget and medium term financial plan. (s) To note potential changes to local authority funding system from 2026- 27 onwards and consequential uncertain financial outlook for later years until a multi-year settlement from government is reintroduced. (t) To note that fundamental changes to social care are unlikely until after Baroness Casey enquiry concludes. (u) To note that the planned use of reserves still ensures sufficient reserves are available in the short term with no immediate concerns triggering a S114 notice provided the use of these reserves is replaced with sustainable savings over the medium term. (v) To note the rate of recent drawdown from reserves and potential drawdown to balance 2024-25 outturn is still cause for serious concern and reserves will still need to be maintained ahead of changes under Devolution White Paper. Further unplanned drawdowns would weaken resilience and should only be considered as a last resort with an agreed strategy to replenish reserves at earliest opportunity.  "

      "(1) Mr John Betts, Interim Corporate Director Finance, as the Section 151 Officer, provided an overview of the Section 25 Assurance Statement. He said there were considerable risks facing the authority in delivering a balanced budget due to a number of factors including the current economic environment, the single year finance settlement for local government, the scale of savings required, and the growing demands on core statutory services. He said all the budget resolutions had undergone extensive scrutiny and reminded Members that the Section 25 Assurance Statement covered the Administration’s proposed budget and all the amendments. He noted that the total of all the revenue amendments for 2025/2026 amounted to 0.4% of the overall budget. Mr Betts explained that provided all the measures set out in the draft budget and the medium term plan were implemented, including the delivery of savings, managing growth, minimising borrowing, and maximising council tax increases and precepts, the Council would continue to demonstrate financial sustainability over the medium term. The assessment was that the overall budget estimates were robust and the levels of reserves were adequate.\n",

(b) The directorate capital programmes as set out in appendices A & B of the final draft budget report published on 5th February 2025. 2025-26 Revenue Budget and Medium Term Financial Plan (c) The net revenue budget requirement of £1,530.9m for 2025-26. (d) The directorate revenue budget proposals for 2025-26 and the medium term financial plan as set out in appendices D (high level county 3 year plan) E (high level 2025-26 plan by directorate), appendix F (individual spending, savings, income and reserves variations for 2025-26) and G (2025-26 key services) of the final draft budget report published on 5th February 2025. 2025-26 Council Tax (e) To increase Council Tax band rates up to the maximum permitted without a referendum as set out in section 6.4 (table 6.1) of the final draft report published on 5th February 2025. (f) The total Council Tax requirement of £994,287,655 to be raised through precepts on districts as set out in section 6.6 (table 6.2) in the final draft report published on 5th February 2025. Kent Pay Scheme 2025-26 (g) Note the transition of all Kent Scheme staff to the new pay structure agreed by County Council in May 2024 (h) Agree to the recommendations on the uplift to Kent Pay Scheme as set out in section 7.9 of the final draft budget published on 5th February 2025 Key Policies and Strategies (i) Fees and charges to continue to be reviewed in line with the policy agreed in the 2023-24 budget approval (j) The Capital Strategy as set out in appendix O of the final draft report published on 5th February 2025 including the Prudential Indicators.

In addition: (o) To delegate authority to the Chief Executive, in consultation with the Leader of the Council and the Cabinet Member for Finance, Corporate and Traded Services, to agree any other non-pay related changes to the Kent Scheme through the conclusion of pay bargaining. (p) To delegate authority to the Corporate Director of Finance (after consultation with the Leader, the Deputy Leader and Cabinet Member for Finance, Corporate & Traded Services and the political Group Leaders) to resolve any minor technical issues and structural changes for the final budget publication which do not materially alter the approved budget or change the net budget requirement and for any changes made to be reflected in the final version of the Budget Book (blue combed) due to be published in March 2025. (q) To note the information on the impact of the County Council’s share of retained business rates, business rate pool and business rate collection fund balances on the revenue budget will be reported to Cabinet once it has all been received. (r) To note the ongoing and escalating cost pressures on the Council’s budget alongside insufficient funding in the local government finance settlement and knock on requirement for savings and income in the final draft 2025-26 budget and medium term financial plan. (s) To note potential changes to local authority funding system from 2026- 27 onwards and consequential uncertain financial outlook for later years until a multi-year settlement from government is reintroduced. (t) To note that fundamental changes to social care are unlikely until after Baroness Casey enquiry concludes. (u) To note that the planned use of reserves still ensures sufficient reserves are available in the short term with no immediate concerns triggering a S114 notice provided the use of these reserves is replaced with sustainable savings over the medium term. (v) To note the rate of recent drawdown from reserves and potential drawdown to balance 2024-25 outturn is still cause for serious concern and reserves will still need to be maintained ahead of changes under Devolution White Paper. Further unplanned drawdowns would weaken resilience and should only be considered as a last resort with an agreed strategy to replenish reserves at earliest opportunity.”\n",

With the future of KCC uncertain, we believe that other than any urgent repair works, no further capital should be spent on the Invicta House refurbishment. With the proposed restructure to local government, a new unitary authority may decide not to include Invicta House as part of its strategic estate. We believe this funding should be used on important assets needed by residents right now rather than for investment in buildings KCC may not require in the future. With the looming ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel vehicles, many Kent residents will be making the switch to electric vehicles. However, not every resident has access to their own driveway or garage and park their cars on the street. The amendment proposes to ‘top-up’ the LEVI grant so that more Kent residents benefit from additional EV charging infrastructure.” Proposed Amount: “£2.149m to ‘top-up’ the LEVI capital project funding.” Proposed Funding Source: “Cancelling the reconfiguration of the 3rd and 4th floor of Invicta House, including provision of Member and CMT spaces.”\n",

We believe this funding should be used on important assets needed by residents right now rather than for investment in buildings KCC may not require in the future.

This extra funding will provide additional support to tackle the ongoing challenges of road maintenance to create long-lasting repairs to Kent’s highways network.” Proposed Amount: “£5.6m to increase the Highways Asset Management/Annual Maintenance capital project.” Proposed Funding Source: “Cancellation of the Scope 2 enhanced works to Invicta House.”\n",

(d) The directorate revenue budget proposals for 2025-26 and the medium term financial plan as set out in appendices D (high level county 3 year plan) E (high level 2025-26 plan by directorate), appendix F (individual spending, savings, income and reserves variations for 2025-26) and G (2025-26 key services) of the final draft budget report published on 5th February 2025. 2025-26 Council Tax (e) To increase Council Tax band rates up to the maximum permitted without a referendum as set out in section 6.4 (table 6.1) of the final draft report published on 5th February 2025. (f) The total Council Tax requirement of £994,287,655 to be raised through precepts on districts as set out in section 6.6 (table 6.2) in the final draft report published on 5th February 2025. Kent Pay Scheme 2025-26 (g) Note the transition of all Kent Scheme staff to the new pay structure agreed by County Council in May 2024 (h) Agree to the recommendations on the uplift to Kent Pay Scheme as set out in section 7.9 of the final draft budget published on 5th February 2025 Key Policies and Strategies (i) Fees and charges to continue to be reviewed in line with the policy agreed in the 2023-24 budget approval (j) The Capital Strategy as set out in appendix O of the final draft report published on 5th February 2025 including the Prudential Indicators. (k) The Treasury Management Strategy as set out in appendix M of the final draft report published on 5th February 2025 (l) The Minimum Revenue Provision (MRP) Statement as set out in appendix P of the final draft report published on 5th February 2025 (m) The Flexible Use of Capital Receipts Strategy as set out in appendix Q of the final draft report published on 5th February 2025. (n) The Reserves Policy as set out in appendix H of the final draft budget report published on 5th February 2025. In addition: (o) To delegate authority to the Chief Executive, in consultation with the Leader of the Council and the Cabinet Member for Finance, Corporate and Traded Services, to agree any other non-pay related changes to the Kent Scheme through the conclusion of pay bargaining. (p) To delegate authority to the Corporate Director of Finance (after consultation with the Leader, the Deputy Leader and Cabinet Member for Finance, Corporate & Traded Services and the political Group Leaders) to resolve any minor technical issues and structural changes for the final budget publication which do not materially alter the approved budget or change the net budget requirement and for any changes made to be reflected in the final version of the Budget Book (blue combed) due to be published in March 2025. (q) To note the information on the impact of the County Council’s share of retained business rates, business rate pool and business rate collection fund balances on the revenue budget will be reported to Cabinet once it has all been received. (r) To note the ongoing and escalating cost pressures on the Council’s budget alongside insufficient funding in the local government finance settlement and knock on requirement for savings and income in the final draft 2025-26 budget and medium term financial plan. (s) To note potential changes to local authority funding system from 2026- 27 onwards and consequential uncertain financial outlook for later years until a multi-year settlement from government is reintroduced. (t) To note that fundamental changes to social care are unlikely until after Baroness Casey enquiry concludes. (u) To note that the planned use of reserves still ensures sufficient reserves are available in the short term with no immediate concerns triggering a S114 notice provided the use of these reserves is replaced with sustainable savings over the medium term. (v) To note the rate of recent drawdown from reserves and potential drawdown to balance 2024-25 outturn is still cause for serious concern and reserves will still need to be maintained ahead of changes under Devolution White Paper. Further unplanned drawdowns would weaken resilience and should only be considered as a last resort with an agreed strategy to replenish reserves at earliest opportunity.\n"
