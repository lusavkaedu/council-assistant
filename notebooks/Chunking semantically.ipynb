      "Trust were working towards a deficit of £85,8m which it was expecting to \n",
      "meet.  \n",
      "b. The Chief Nurse had conducted a review of safer staffing during 2024. The \n",
      "review led to the recruitment of permanent staff thus reducing reliance on \n",
      "temporary workers which was expensive. \n",
      "c. The Trust’s improvement plans for 2025/26 focussed on medical agency \n",
      "spending and length of stay in hospitals. \n",
      "2. In response to comments and questions it was said: \n",
      "a. The Trust were reliant on a number of temporary medical staff due to \n",
      "challenges in recruiting to some specific specialties. Ms van der Lem \n",
      "explained improvements would not come from just recruiting permanent \n",
      "staff to those posts, but understanding how to deliver services in the most \n",
      "productive way possible. Positive steps had been made, such as the \n",
      "increase from 3 to 10 substantive Emergency Department consultants \n",
      "since the start of the year. \n",
      "b. The Trust tended to use bank staff as opposed to agency staff. Reasons \n",
      "cited for working for an agency instead of being directly employed included \n",
      "pay and flexibility. Quality of service could be impacted as agency staff \n",

      "80% of positions recruited to over winter had been filled. In addition, 90% \n",
      "of student nurses had chosen East Kent as their new employer. The \n",
      "overall turnover and vacancy rate at the Trust was low. \n",
      "d. Retention was important, and this was aided by the support package on \n",
      "offer. \n",
      "e. Length of stay for patients was prolonged by the shortage of social care \n",
      "support. Whilst the Trust played a role in reducing this, collaborative work \n",
      "across partners was required (and already happening). The readmittance \n",

      "commissioning decision, but because the provider handed back the contract as \n",
      "they were no longer in a position to provide the service. One of the reasons cited \n",

The idea of quarterly targets had been raised to have a continuous improvement approach. Regarding the take-up of early free education places, Ms Atkinson explained that it was seasonal, there were significant changes within the early years sector that was affecting take-up rates. Further indicators for early years were going to be explored to provide more information. Mr Love added in October 2023 the oldest EHCP case was 124 weeks old, compared to updated figures where the oldest case was around 20 weeks old. The service was significantly improving, there was an aim to chase targets but not compromise quality. b. Mr Chapman shared that the volume of available Educational Psychologists was limited, there was an intention to make better use of staff time rather than increasing the numbers, additionally Educational Psychologists were aiming to increase their availability. c. In order to tackle persistent absences in schools a multi-disciplinary approach was required, there had been more challenges in schools since the COVID-19 Pandemic. There was research going into emotional based school avoidance, how to support schools with this and ensure front line staff understanding. The was going to be a session with Assistant Directors about absence, and how to make sure all those involved had a full understanding of the causes, the way to address it and the support that could be offered. Last year training was developed for front line staff, there was a desire to refresh and expand this. Ms Chandler added that school avoidance was a key issue for early help teams and that there was work being done to tackle this issue. Ms Hammond added that there was an 3 annual meeting with two South East local authority colleagues for peer review, the topic for the upcoming meeting was long term school absences. d. A Member noted the importance of clear thresholds and criteria for the balance of mainstream inclusion and special school places, explaining that national Government and the Tribunal System needed to define these. Mr Love agreed that there was a need for further collaboration with the Government to refine and strengthen guidance. Additionally, the Tribunal Service needed to consider the broader responsibilities of Local Authorities in resource allocation. The thresholds for EHCP’s used by KCC were those outlined in the SEND Code of Practice. Mr Love was to continue his dialog with Head Teacher’s and Principal’s around this topic. Ms McInnes added that guidance was needed, Officers had been supporting school leaders in Kent to develop that guidance and descriptors, the document was in its final stages. There was a working group of special school Head Teachers who were developing the criteria for the different types of special needs, to help identify which children were best placed in special schools, the document was to be published in May 2025.</td>\n",

Ms McInnes recognised the issue of Educational Psychologists not receiving required information in a timely manner from schools. To combat this, termly Special Educational Needs Coordinator (SENCO) briefings had been established, there were separate briefings for early years, primary and secondary to address individual issues. These briefings had been running for 18 months, the benefits of the SENCO’s work was being seen. RESOLVED that the Committee noted the update.</td>\n",

Mr Love highlighted the KPI for the number of EHCP’s issued within 20\\nweeks, emphasising the importance of ensuring improvements within this\\nprocess were long term and sustainable. Additionally, noting that there has\\nbeen significant improvements in progress, Mr Love was confident that for\\nFebruary, Kent would be within the top quartile of performers in England.   \n",
       "12  3. In response to comments and questions it was said: a. Ms Atkinson shared that the backlog of cases had decreased and the timelines of EHCP’s was under control. The idea of quarterly targets had been raised to have a continuous improvement approach. Regarding the take-up of early free education places, Ms Atkinson explained that it was seasonal, there were significant changes within the early years sector that was affecting take-up rates. Further indicators for early years were going to be explored to provide more information. Mr Love added in October 2023 the oldest EHCP case was 124 weeks old, compared to updated figures where the oldest case was around 20 weeks old. The service was significantly improving, there was an aim to chase targets but not compromise quality. b. Mr Chapman shared that the volume of available Educational Psychologists was limited, there was an intention to make better use of staff time rather than increasing the numbers, additionally Educational Psychologists were aiming to increase their availability. c. In order to tackle persistent absences in schools a multi-disciplinary approach was required, there had been more challenges in schools since the COVID-19 Pandemic. There was research going into emotional based school avoidance, how to support schools with this and ensure front line staff understanding. The was going to be a session with Assistant Directors about absence, and how to make sure all those involved had a full understanding of the causes, the way to address it and the support that could be offered. Last year training was developed for front line staff, there was a desire to refresh and expand this. Ms Chandler added that school avoidance was a key issue for early help teams and that there was work being done to tackle this issue. Ms Hammond added that there was an 3 annual meeting with two South East local authority colleagues for peer review, the topic for the upcoming meeting was long term school absences. d. A Member noted the importance of clear thresholds and criteria for the balance of mainstream inclusion and special school places, explaining that national Government and the Tribunal System needed to define these. Mr Love agreed that there was a need for further collaboration with the Government to refine and strengthen guidance. Additionally, the Tribunal Service needed to consider the broader responsibilities of Local Authorities in resource allocation. The thresholds for EHCP’s used by KCC were those outlined in the SEND Code of Practice. Mr Love was to continue his dialog with Head Teacher’s and Principal’s around this topic.

In response to comments and questions it was said:\\na. Ms McInnes shared that there was work being done to reduce the\\nfigures associated with the non-maintained and independent special\\nschool placements. This was being done through strengthening the\\ncommissioning system, there were visits to non-maintained and\\nindependent special schools being undertaken in order to check that\\nyoung people were attending school and receiving the correct\\nservices. Additionally, issues were addressed through the special\\nschool review. Mrs Chandler explained that the Policy and Resources\\nCabinet Committee covered procurement which provided a level of\\noversight.

Additionally, noting that there has\\nbeen significant improvements in progress, Mr Love was confident that for\\nFebruary, Kent would be within the top quartile of performers in England.\\n\\n3. In response to comments and questions it was said: a. Ms Atkinson shared that the backlog of cases had decreased and the timelines of EHCP’s was under control. The idea of quarterly targets had been raised to have a continuous improvement approach. Regarding the take-up of early free education places, Ms Atkinson explained that it was seasonal, there were significant changes within the early years sector that was affecting take-up rates. Further indicators for early years were going to be explored to provide more information. Mr Love added in October 2023 the oldest EHCP case was 124 weeks old, compared to updated figures where the oldest case was around 20 weeks old. The service was significantly improving, there was an aim to chase targets but not compromise quality. b. Mr Chapman shared that the volume of available Educational Psychologists was limited, there was an intention to make better use of staff time rather than increasing the numbers, additionally Educational Psychologists were aiming to increase their availability. c. In order to tackle persistent absences in schools a multi-disciplinary approach was required, there had been more challenges in schools since the COVID-19 Pandemic. There was research going into emotional based school avoidance, how to support schools with this and ensure front line staff understanding. The was going to be a session with Assistant Directors about absence, and how to make sure all those involved had a full understanding of the causes, the way to address it and the support that could be offered. Last year training was developed for front line staff, there was a desire to refresh and expand this.

Ms Hammond added that there was an 3 annual meeting with two South East local authority colleagues for peer review, the topic for the upcoming meeting was long term school absences. d. A Member noted the importance of clear thresholds and criteria for the balance of mainstream inclusion and special school places, explaining that national Government and the Tribunal System needed to define these. Mr Love agreed that there was a need for further collaboration with the Government to refine and strengthen guidance. Additionally, the Tribunal Service needed to consider the broader responsibilities of Local Authorities in resource allocation. The thresholds for EHCP’s used by KCC were those outlined in the SEND Code of Practice. Mr Love was to continue his dialog with Head Teacher’s and Principal’s around this topic. Ms McInnes added that guidance was needed, Officers had been supporting school leaders in Kent to develop that guidance and descriptors, the document was in its final stages. There was a working group of special school Head Teachers who were developing the criteria for the different types of special needs, to help identify which children were best placed in special schools, the document was to be published in May 2025. e. Ms McInnes recognised the issue of Educational Psychologists not receiving required information in a timely manner from schools. To combat this, termly Special Educational Needs Coordinator (SENCO) briefings had been established, there were separate briefings for early years, primary and secondary to address individual issues. These briefings had been running for 18 months, the benefits of the SENCO’s work was being seen. RESOLVED that the Committee noted the update.</td>\n",

Additionally, issues were addressed through the special\\nschool review. Mrs Chandler explained that the Policy and Resources\\nCabinet Committee covered procurement which provided a level of\\noversight.

Ms Holden explained that according to the SEND Code of Practice\\nthe Local Authority had to cover the costs of any failures in NHS\\ncommissioning. The contract represented 20% of the total therapy\\nprovision across the county, which covered KCC's statutory delivery\\nfor therapy for children who needed it in order to access the education\\ncurriculum. Additionally, within the new contract, the service delivery\\nmodel was to be changed to drive efficiency, the NHS invested in the\\nBalance System model in 2020, the providers had been adapting their\\nmodel which increased the efficiency of the system.\\nb. The NHS invested £13 million into therapeutic services, whilst the\\nLocal Authority invested £2.2 million, there was intention to bring a\\nproportion of that funding in-house for physiotherapy and occupational\\ntherapy delivery, £1.8 million would be reprocured for speech,\\nlanguage and communication needs.\\nc. Due to the contracts being legacy NHS provider contracts, the Local\\nAuthority did not have oversight of the KPI’s on the provider contracts,\\nthis was to change to ensure the Local Authority had further oversight\\nand decision making powers in the KPI’s.\\nd.

In response to comments and questions it was said: a. Ms Atkinson shared that the backlog of cases had decreased and the timelines of EHCP’s was under control. The idea of quarterly targets had been raised to have a continuous improvement approach. Regarding the take-up of early free education places, Ms Atkinson explained that it was seasonal, there were significant changes within the early years sector that was affecting take-up rates. Further indicators for early years were going to be explored to provide more information. Mr Love added in October 2023 the oldest EHCP case was 124 weeks old, compared to updated figures where the oldest case was around 20 weeks old. The service was significantly improving, there was an aim to chase targets but not compromise quality. b. Mr Chapman shared that the volume of available Educational Psychologists was limited, there was an intention to make better use of staff time rather than increasing the numbers, additionally Educational Psychologists were aiming to increase their availability. c. In order to tackle persistent absences in schools a multi-disciplinary approach was required, there had been more challenges in schools since the COVID-19 Pandemic. There was research going into emotional based school avoidance, how to support schools with this and ensure front line staff understanding. The was going to be a session with Assistant Directors about absence, and how to make sure all those involved had a full understanding of the causes, the way to address it and the support that could be offered. Last year training was developed for front line staff, there was a desire to refresh and expand this. Ms Chandler added that school avoidance was a key issue for early help teams and that there was work being   \n",

Ms Hammond added that there was an 3 annual meeting with two South East local authority colleagues for peer review, the topic for the upcoming meeting was long term school absences. d. A Member noted the importance of clear thresholds and criteria for the balance of mainstream inclusion and special school places, explaining that national Government and the Tribunal System needed to define these. Mr Love agreed that there was a need for further collaboration with the Government to refine and strengthen guidance. Additionally, the Tribunal Service needed to consider the broader responsibilities of Local Authorities in resource allocation. The thresholds for EHCP’s used by KCC were those outlined in the SEND Code of Practice. Mr Love was to continue his dialog with Head Teacher’s and Principal’s around this topic. Ms McInnes added that guidance was needed, Officers had been supporting school leaders in Kent to develop that guidance and descriptors, the document was in its final stages. There was a working group of special school Head Teachers who were developing the criteria for the different types of special needs, to help identify which children were best placed in special schools, the document was to be published in May 2025. e. Ms McInnes recognised the issue of Educational Psychologists not receiving required information in a timely manner from schools. To combat this, termly Special Educational Needs Coordinator (SENCO) briefings had been established, there were separate briefings for early years, primary and secondary to address individual issues. These briefings had been running for 18 months, the benefits of the SENCO’s work was being seen. RESOLVED that the Committee noted the update.   \n",

In response to comments and questions it was said:\\na. Ms McInnes shared that there was work being done to reduce the\\nfigures associated with the non-maintained and independent special\\nschool placements. This was being done through strengthening the\\ncommissioning system, there were visits to non-maintained and\\nindependent special schools being undertaken in order to check that\\nyoung people were attending school and receiving the correct\\nservices. Additionally, issues were addressed through the special\\nschool review. Mrs Chandler explained that the Policy and Resources\\nCabinet Committee covered procurement which provided a level of\\noversight. Mr Love added that the special school review was\\nimportant to ensure that the right provision was in the right place.\\nThere were expansions taking place on schools and new schools\\nwere being opened with the aim of being able to have the option to\\nsend children and young people to maintained special schools.\\n4\\nb. Ms Hammond explained that there would always be a need for\\nindependent special schools, whilst they could be specialised and\\ntargeted, they came at a significant cost.\\nRESOLVED that the Committee noted the report.\\n\\n26.

In response to comments and questions it was said:\\na. Mr Love explained that the safety valve was not the highest risk to\\nKCC rather it was the historic overspending on the high needs\\nspending block. There was a vast amount of work done to bring\\nspending down in line with government allocation. It was believed that\\nthe safety valve was a part of the solution not the risk.\\nRESOLVED that the Committee considered the risks presented.\\n\\n27. 25/00022 Admission Arrangements and Scheme for 2026-27 Academic Year\\n(Item 9)\\n\\n1. Mr Chapman introduced the annual report and gave an overview of its\\ncontent.\\n\\n2. In response to comments and questions it was said:\\na. Mr Chapman shared that proposed developments were considered in\\nareas where reductions were agreed. An advantage of the\\narrangement of the admissions process was that if there was an\\nunexpected influx of children, schools were able to offer places above\\ntheir PAN. Mr Love added that future developments were taken into\\nconsideration in the Annual Kent Commissioning Plan, which was a\\nfive year rolling programme that had a significant amount of\\nbackground intelligence, with the opportunity to adjust if needed.\\nb. When asked if schools would be provided with additional assistance\\nas school boundaries changed. Mr Chapman explained that this issue\\nwould not be directly addressed through the admission process,\\nhowever it was confirmed that there would be adjustments to funding\\nrelative to need.\\nRESOLVED that the Committee considered and endorsed the decision of the\\ndetermined admission arrangements.\\n\\n28. 25/00032 Therapies – Recommissioning of SEN Therapy provision to enable\\naccess to the Education Curriculum\\n(Item 10)\\n5\\n\\n1. Ms Holden, introduced the report and gave an overview of its content.\\n\\n2. In response to comments and questions it was said:\\na. Ms Holden explained that according to the SEND Code of Practice\\nthe Local Authority had to cover the costs of any failures in NHS\\ncommissioning. The contract represented 20% of the total therapy\\nprovision across the county, which covered KCC's statutory delivery\\nfor therapy for children who needed it in order to access the education\\ncurriculum. Additionally, within the new contract, the service delivery\\nmodel was to be changed to drive efficiency, the NHS invested in the\\nBalance System model in 2020, the providers had been adapting their\\nmodel which increased the efficiency of the system.\\nb. The NHS invested £13 million into therapeutic services, whilst the\\nLocal Authority invested £2.2 million, there was intention to bring a\\nproportion of that funding in-house for physiotherapy and occupational\\ntherapy delivery, £1.8 million would be reprocured for speech,\\nlanguage and communication needs.\\nc. Due to the contracts being legacy NHS provider contracts, the Local\\nAuthority did not have oversight of the KPI’s on the provider contracts,\\nthis was to change to ensure the Local Authority had further oversight\\nand decision making powers in the KPI’s.\\nd.
