    "1. Introduction and Background\n",
    "1.1 As the minerals and waste planning authority for Kent, the County Council is\n",
    "required to prepare and maintain planning policy concerning waste\n",
    "management and minerals supply in the County. The Kent Minerals and\n",
    "Waste Local Plan 2013-30 was adopted by the Council in July 2016 and sets\n",
    "out the strategy and policy framework for minerals and waste development in\n",
    "Kent which includes future capacity and supply requirements. The Kent\n",
    "Minerals and Waste Local Plan, together with the Kent Mineral Sites Plan,\n",
    "forms part of the Development Plan for Kent which is key, both for the\n",
    "determination of planning applications for minerals and waste development\n",
    "by the County Council, and applications relating to other development that\n",
    "may affect minerals and waste development or other aspects determined by\n",
    "the District and Borough Councils in Kent.\n",
    "1.2 Following its adoption, the Kent Minerals and Waste Local Plan 2016 was\n",
    "subject to an ‘Early Partial Review’ and changes to the Plan resulting from\n",
    "this review were adopted by the Council in September 2020. Also in\n",
    "September 2020, the Council adopted the Kent Mineral Sites Plan.\n",
    "1.3 The National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) and associated legislation\n",
    "states policies in Local Plans should be reviewed at least once every five\n",
    "years to assess whether they need updating and should then be updated, as\n",
    "necessary. A review of the Vision, Strategic Objectives and policies in the\n",
    "Kent Minerals and Waste Local Plan was undertaken in 2021 that concluded\n",
    "a need for updates to the Plan in response to relevant Government policy\n",
    "and legislation published since the Plan was adopted in 2016. The review\n",
    "also identified changes to the local context requiring further updates to be\n",
    "made.\n",

    "and Transport Cabinet Committee, the Cabinet Members with responsibility\n",
    "for the Local Plan and subsequently County Council in December 2023. This\n",
    "Plan included changes to the adopted Plan which can be summarised as\n",
    "follows:\n",
    "• Updates to the National Planning Policy Framework in 2018,\n",
    "2019 and 2021 and associated Planning Practice Guidance;\n",
    "• legislation and policy concerning: The need to adapt to, and\n",
    "mitigate, climate change; and, associated low carbon\n",
    "growth;\n",
    "• policy and legislation concerned with achieving a circular\n",
    "economy where more waste is prevented or reused;\n",
    "• adoption by the County Council of the Kent Environment\n",
    "Strategy and Kent and Medway Energy and Low Emissions\n",
    "Strategy;\n",
    "• extending the plan period to 2039;\n",
    "• updates to aggregate requirements in Policy CSM2 and\n",
    "waste management targets in Policy CSW4;\n",
    "• deletion of Policy CSM5 that allocates a strategic site for\n",
    "minerals (as planning permission has been granted);\n",
    "• removal of a strategic site allocation at Norwood Quarry,\n",
    "Sheppey for the landfill of hazardous waste specifically\n",
    "incinerator fly ash (Policy CSW5);\n",
    "• a recognition within supporting text of the need for the\n",
    "development of additional capacity for the management of\n",
    "household waste identified by the Waste Disposal Authority;\n",
    "• removal of a commitment to make specific provision for the\n",
    "management of residual non-hazardous waste by landfill or\n",
    "energy recovery that arises in London;\n",
    "• Changes to Policy CSW17 relating to waste management at\n",
    "Dungeness were made to ensure that it is consistent with\n",
    "national policy.\n",
    "• a change to Policy DM3 seeking the achievement of\n",
    "maximum biodiversity net gain on the basis that restoration\n",
    "of quarries can often easily result in much greater than the\n",
    "statutory minimum of 10% and Kent Nature Partnership\n",
    "preferred level of 20%;\n",
    "• changes to settlement boundaries affecting the extent of\n",
    "areas identified in the Kent Minerals and Waste Local Plan\n",
    "where the presence of economic minerals needs to be taken\n",
    "into account before surface development can take place.\n",
    "These areas are known as ‘Mineral Safeguarding Areas;\n",
    "• changes to the monitoring framework to ensure it properly\n",
    "reflects the updated policies; and,\n",
    "• further changes intended to improve the clarity of the Plan’s\n",
    "wording and hence the meaning of certain objectives and\n",
    "policies.\n",
    "Independent Examination\n",
    "1.8 Before the updated Plan can be adopted by the Council, it must be submitted\n",
    "to the Secretary of State for independent Examination by a Government-\n",
    "appointed inspector. The examination is to determine whether the Plan is\n",
    "sound and has been prepared in accordance with statutory plan making\n",
    "requirements. The National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) defines a\n",
    "‘sound’ local plan as one that is:\n",
    "a) Positively prepared – provides a strategy which, as a minimum,\n",
    "seeks to meet the area’s objectively assessed need; and is informed\n",
    "by agreements with other authorities, so that unmet need from\n",
    "neighbouring areas is accommodated where it is practical to do so\n",
    "and is consistent with achieving sustainable development;\n",
    "b) Justified – an appropriate strategy, taking into account the\n",
    "reasonable alternatives, and based on proportionate evidence;\n",
    "c) Effective – deliverable over the plan period, and based on effective\n",
    "joint working on cross-boundary strategic matters that have been dealt\n",
    "with rather than deferred, as evidenced by the statement of common\n",
    "ground; and,\n",
    "d) Consistent with national policy – enabling the delivery of\n",
    "sustainable development in accordance with the policies in the NPPF\n",
    "and other statements of national planning policy, where relevant.\n",
    "1.9 Prior to its submission to the Secretary of State, the Plan was published for a\n",
    "statutory minimum six-week period1 providing an opportunity for communities\n",
    "and other stakeholders to provide views on whether they thought the Plan\n",
    "1 Regulation 19 of the Town and Country Planning (Local Planning) (England) Regulations 2012 (as\n",
    "amended).\n",
    "was sound and legally compliant. In response to this consultation 58\n",
    "representations were received.\n",
    "1.10 The updated Plan, evidence base documents and the representations were\n",
    "submitted in May 2024 and the Secretary of State appointed Planning\n",
    "Inspector Joanne Burston BSc MA MRTPI AIPROW to examine the Plan.\n",
    "The Inspector convened public hearings for four days in September 2024.\n",
    "1.11 During the examination, the Inspector considered all the representations\n",
    "received. At the request of the Council, the Inspector considered a small\n",
    "number of changes needed to ensure soundness of the Plan (known as\n",
    "‘main modifications’). In addition, a number of minor modifications (known as\n",
    "additional modifications) were also proposed. These latter seek to improve\n",
    "the clarity of the plan and addressed presentation and typographical or\n",
    "factual changes such as revised government department names. These\n",
    "additional modifications were not necessary to address soundness and legal\n",
    "compliance matters. The modifications were discussed with the Council and\n",
    "representors during the hearings as well as the KCC Cabinet Member for\n",
    "Economic Development.\n",
    "1.12 Following the hearings, the proposed main modifications were published for\n",
    "representations over a six-week period from 17 October 2024 to 28\n",
    "November 2024. 25. Representations were received from 25 parties during\n",
    "the consultation which were considered by the Inspector, but these did not\n",
    "result in any further main modifications. A number of minor (additional)\n",
    "modifications were however proposed to address comments raised. A copy\n",
    "of the Plan showing the modifications arising from the inspector’s\n",
    "examination as tracked changes is included at Appendix C.\n",
    "1.13 The Council received the report of the Inspector on 6th February 2025 and\n",
    "this Cabinet report provides a summary and details of next steps.\n",
    "2. The Inspector’s Report\n",
    "2.1 The Inspector’s Report is included in Appendix A and this confirms that,\n",
    "subject to modifications, the submitted Kent Minerals and Waste Local Plan\n",
    "2024-39 is ‘sound’ and has been prepared in accordance with statutory plan\n",
    "making requirements.\n",
    "2.2. The modifications are set out in Appendix 1 of the Inspector’s Report with\n",
    "justification included in the body of her report. The main modifications\n",
    "concerned tightening up the wording of the Plan in a number of areas as\n",
    "follows:\n",
    "• Changes to ensure consistency with current terminology,\n",
    "legislation, policies, and guidance (e.g., replacing \"Areas of\n",
    "Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB)\" with \"National\n",
    "Landscapes\"; reference to the latest Kent Joint Municipal\n",
    "Waste Management Strategy);\n",
    "• updates to references to organisations which have an\n",
    "interest in the Plan e.g. addition of reference to Ebbsfleet\n",
    "Development Corporation and Kent and Medway Economic\n",
    "Partnership (KMEP);\n",
    "• update to footnotes to clarify references to relevant\n",
    "documents;\n",
    "• changes to supporting text and policies to ensure the Plan’s\n",
    "intentions are clear e.g. deletion of reference to ‘Mineral\n",
    "Consultation Areas’ as these are the same as ‘Mineral\n",
    "Safeguarding Areas’ and use of a separate term may cause\n",
    "confusion;\n",
    "• Amendments to supporting text and Policies: CSW 3; CSW\n",
    "4; CSW 6; CSW 15; DM 2; DM 3; DM 4; DM 7; DM 10; DM\n",
    "13; DM 14; DM 17; DM19; DM 20; and DM 22 to ensure that\n",
    "they are effective and/or consistent with national policy.\n",
    "• Specific changes to policy included:\n",
    "o A change to Policy CSW15 to reflect potential need\n",
    "for upgrades to wastewater treatment works to control\n",
    "releases of nitrates and phosphates to watercourses;\n",
    "o Updates to Policy DM2 to ensure consistency with\n",
    "statutory requirements in relation to protection of\n",
    "landscapes; internationally and nationally designated\n",
    "habitats;\n",
    "o Updates to Policy DM10 to ensure consistency with\n",
    "Environment Agency requirements concerning the\n",
    "protection of the water environment;\n",
    "2.3 The modifications are taken into account in the text of the Plan provided in\n",
    "Appendix B to this report. Importantly, the modifications do not alter the\n",
    "objectives or intentions of policy. The Plan in Appendix B will upon adoption\n",
    "become the published Kent Minerals and Waste Local Plan Strategy upon\n",
    "which planning decisions in the County will be determined.\n",
    "2.4 The additional modifications referred to above were also published for\n",
    "information alongside the main modifications.\n",
    "3. Strategic environmental assessment and sustainability appraisal\n",
    "3.1 During its preparation, the Kent Minerals and Waste Local Plan 2024-39 was\n",
    "subject to sustainability appraisal (SA) (incorporating strategic environmental\n",
    "assessment (SEA)). The SA report provides an assessments of impacts\n",
    "(both beneficial and detrimental) on environmental, social and economic\n",
    "objectives which are expected to arise from development consistent with the\n",
    "Kent Minerals and Waste Local Plan 2024-39. The SA also considered\n",
    "reasonable alternatives to the proposals in the Kent Minerals and Waste\n",
    "Local Plan 2024-39. The recommendations from the SA were taken into\n",
    "account as the Plan was prepared.\n",
    "3.2 A non-technical summary of the SA of the Kent Minerals and Waste Local\n",
    "Plan 2024-39 (with modifications recommended by the Inspector) is included\n",
    "in Appendix D. The full SA report is available on the Council’s website here .\n",
    "The inspector concluded that the SA was in line with the legal requirements\n",
    "4. Adoption\n",
    "4.1 In accordance with Section 23 (3) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase\n",
    "Act 2004, having received a report confirming the soundness and legality of\n",
    "the Kent Minerals and Waste Local Plan 2024-39, provided the Council\n",
    "makes the modifications recommended by the Inspector, it may now adopt\n",
    "the Kent Minerals and Waste Local Plan 2024-39 as updated planning policy\n",
    "for minerals supply and waste management in Kent.\n",
    "4.2 The new and revised policy will be used by the County Council when\n",
    "determining planning applications related to proposals for waste\n",
    "management and minerals supply. It will ensure that planning decisions in\n",
    "Kent will be made in accordance with national policy and have regard to local\n",
    "policy considerations, such as the Kent Environment Strategy and the Kent\n",
    "and Medway Energy and Low Emissions Strategy. The updated policies\n",
    "concerning mineral and waste safeguarding and the circular economy will\n",
    "also be used by District and Borough Councils when determining applications\n",
    "for non-waste and mineral development. It should be noted that the adopted\n",
    "Kent Mineral Sites Plan remains in place and information concerning a\n",
    "related potential change to that Plan is included below (see paragraphs 4.3\n",
    "and 6.2-6.4).\n",
    "4.3 Members may recall that there is considerable objection to the Mineral Sites\n",
    "Plan work and in particular the merits of the nominated hard rock site at\n",
    "Oaken Wood, Aylesford, that has been submitted in response to the\n",
    "Council’s ‘call for sites’ as part of the Sites Plan work. For the avoidance of\n",
    "doubt, the Kent Mineral and Waste Local Plan 2024-39 before Cabinet\n",
    "makes no decision in relation to the Oaken Wood site. This is a matter for\n",
    "the separate Mineral Sites Plan work. Work on the review of this Plan is\n",
    "ongoing and currently subject to detailed technical assessment of the\n",
    "submitted hard rock site. Until that assessment is complete, no decision can\n",
    "be taken on whether the site should be allocated or not. Once the\n",
    "assessment is complete, a report will be considered by a future Growth,\n",
    "Economic Development and Communities Cabinet Committee. The KMWLP\n",
    "before Cabinet for adoption provides the strategy for minerals supply\n",
    "including the quantity of minerals required, not where sites to meet this need\n",
    "are to be allocated.\n",
    "5. Kent Minerals and Waste Local Plan 2024-39 - Next Steps\n",
    "5.1 Following consideration by Growth, Economic Development and\n",
    "Communities Cabinet Committee (6th March 2025) and Cabinet, County\n",
    "Council will be asked to agree that the Kent Minerals and Waste Local Plan\n",
    "2024-39 be adopted as updated waste and minerals planning policy for Kent.\n",
    "In accordance with Regulation 26 of the Town and Country Planning (Local\n",
    "Planning) (England) Regulations 2012 (as amended) stakeholders will be\n",
    "notified of the Council’s adoption of the updated planning policy.\n",
    "5.2 Prior to final publication of the Plan, minor non-material changes (e.g.\n",
    "changes related to format and grammar) may be needed, and it is proposed\n",
    "if required that the agreement to such changes be delegated to the\n",
    "Corporate Director for Growth, Environment and Transport, in consultation\n",
    "with the Cabinet Member for Economic Development.\n",
    "5.3 Following adoption there is a six-week period for legal challenges. To be\n",
    "successful any such challenge would need to demonstrate that the Kent\n",
    "Minerals and Waste Local Plan 2024-39 has not been prepared in\n",
    "accordance with the relevant legislation.\n",
    "5.4 Once adopted, policies in the Plan will be implemented and monitoring will be\n",
    "undertaken to assess the effect of the policies. Legislation requires a review\n",
    "of planning policy every five years and so the outcome of a review of Kent\n",
    "Minerals and Waste Local Plan 2024-39 policies will be required by 2030.\n",
    "6. Financial Implications\n",
    "6.1 The costs of preparing and adopting the Kent Minerals and Waste Local Plan\n",
    "2024-39 has been met from the existing Planning Applications Group\n",
    "budget.\n",
    "6.2 Implementation of the Plan will ensure the wider Kent economy continues to\n",
    "benefit from the sustainable management of waste and supply of minerals\n",
    "within its area. For example, costs of waste management and mineral supply\n",
    "to businesses in Kent would be higher if a Plan was not in place which does\n",
    "not clearly state how and where waste can be managed and minerals\n",
    "supplied in Kent. It would also assist in measures to address fly-tipping by\n",
    "providing adequate capacity and facilities to manage Kent’s waste.\n",
    "7. Policy Framework\n",
    "7.1 Updating minerals and waste planning policies takes account of changes since\n",
    "2016 to national planning policy and guidance and the County Council’s\n",
    "corporate policies which are concerned with the way in which land is\n",

    "a Development Plan (local plan) setting out how mineral and waste planning\n",

    "in July 2016 and partially updated in 2020 set out the overarching strategy and\n",
    "vision until 2030.\n",
    "10.2 In accordance with statutory requirements, a full review of the Kent Mineral\n",
    "and Waste Local Plan was undertaken in 2021 which revealed the need for\n",
    "updates to the Plan to bring it into line with Government and local policy,\n",
    "legislation, and to reflect changes to other factors affecting future waste\n",
    "management and mineral supply in Kent. Changes to the Plan were proposed,\n",
    "consulted upon and ultimately examined by a Planning Inspector.\n",
    "10.3 Before the updated Kent Mineral and Waste Local Plan can be adopted, the\n",
    "Council must receive a report from the Planning Inspectorate (on behalf of the\n",
    "Secretary of State) which states that the Plan is sound and has been prepared\n",

The Leader of the Labour Group, Mr Brady, thanked and paid tribute to the previous Leader of the Labour Group, Dr Sullivan. 9. Mr Brady commented that his party supported the Financial Hardship Programme as an initiative which benefitted Kent’s residents and businesses. 10. Mr Brady referred to the topic of housing and stated that his party awaited the deliverance of Framing Kent’s Future first pledges in relation to infrastructure and welcomed the new Labour government taking the lead on Infrastructure First. 11. Mr Brady acknowledged the results of the general election and welcomed the 11 Labour MPs throughout Kent. 12. In reference to the King’s Speech, Mr Brady highlighted and endorsed the new government’s proposed bills including those related to budget responsibility, support for Kent workers, new powers to deal with anti-social behaviour, public transport and railway reform, water quality, education and apprenticeships, mental health support, child poverty and wellbeing, and trade and investment with the EU. 13. Mr Lehmann, Leader of the Green and Independents Group, acknowledged the results of the recent general election and confirmed that the Green Party had received over 1.8 million votes nationally and the 4 MPs would represent nearly half a million voters each in the House of Commons. 14. Mr Lehmann explained that the global increase in temperature had made May and June 2024 the hottest ever recorded. The past 13 consecutive months were the hottest recorded for the respective time of year, with an estimated 95% chance 2024 would be the hottest year on record. He suggested that the climate crisis had not been given enough prominence during previous Full Council meetings. He said that multiyear settlements were a good start and hoped the new government would be able to provide both financial and policy support in relation to the growing climate crisis. 15. In relation to the King’s speech, he referred to several proposals including bringing rail services back into public ownership and the bill to ban conversion therapy. 16. In relation to the devolution of powers, Mr Lehmann confirmed that his group opposed the idea of concentrated decision-making power into a single representative and noted with concern that Labour adopted the outgoing government’s position in relation to directly elected mayors. 17. Mr Lehmann voiced some concerns relating to the proposed planning reforms but confirmed that he was in support of the rapid lifting of the de facto ban on new onshore wind farms. 18. Mr Lehmann closed by confirming his relief that the planned London resort project had ceased. He commented that the project would have impacted the biodiversity and insect life of north Kent as well as creating a strain on the local road network. He thanked the Save Swanscombe Peninsula Campaign for their work over many years in protecting the land. 19. Mr Streatfeild on behalf of the Liberal Democrats Group acknowledged the general election results and welcomed the first Liberal Democrat MP in Kent. 20. In relation to the King’s speech, Mr Streatfeild stated that he felt the NHS should be at the heart of the reforms with a legal right to be seen by a GP within one week. On the topic of devolution, he confirmed that his party did not share the Labour views for a Metro Mayor but did have the same enthusiasm for devolution. 21. Mr Streatfeild referred to Unaccompanied Asylum Seeking Children (UASC) and the National Transfer Scheme and questioned whether the new government would require local authorities to look after children who arrived in Kent, or instead, set up a national child refugee agency to meet the national responsibility. 22. Mr Streatfeild highlighted the current consultation on SEND specialist schools and the views submitted by headteachers that contrasted with the Council’s position. 23. Mr Streatfeild referred to the Household Support Fund and said that he hoped the government would take the Liberal Democrat view on Adult Social Care and commented on the Council’s ASCH Charging Policy which now took into account the higher rate of Disability Living Allowance (DLA), Personal Independent Payment (PIP) and Attendance Allowance (AA) when calculating the cost of care and support. 24. Mr Gough responded to the points raised about Infrastructure First and commented that work was carried out within the constraints of a national system, particularly in relation to developer contributions when it came to building school capacity. 25. In response to the point made about devolution, the Leader commented that the new administration was building on a previous levelling up white paper, although with some differences for example in relation to a less prescriptive approach to mayors. 26. In response to comments regarding climate change, the Leader stated that the Council sought to discharge the responsibilities within its remit. He highlighted that the reduction of greenhouse gasses from the Council’s estate and operations, the local nature recovery strategy ‘Making Space for Nature’, and mitigation around flooding, demonstrated the administration’s awareness to the consequences of climate change. 27. The Leader identified that, from the comments made, there was common ground in relation to concerns surrounding planning changes. 28. In response to comments made about buses, the Leader said that whilst there was a range of options, funding was the key issue. He referred to the use of the Bus Service Improvement Plan (BSIP) to secure school transport. 29. In response to the point raised about SEND, the Leader commented that the approach taken in this area should be evidence based and was linked to a wider systemic issue. He referred to the programme the Council had undertaken in relation to significant change within SEND and highlighted the challenges in the current framework that needed to be addressed nationally to provide an affordable outcome for services for children and families. 30. RESOLVED that the Leader’s Report be noted. 240. E nd of Year Performance Report 2023/24 (Item 8) 1. Mr Grough proposed, and Mr Oakford seconded the motion that: “County Council is asked to note the Performance Report.” 2. The Chairman put the motion set out in paragraph 1. 3. RESOLVED that the County Council notes the Performance Report. 241. I ntegrated Care Partnership Terms of Reference (Item 9) 1. Mr Gough proposed, and Mr Watkins seconded the motion that “County Council is asked to approve the refreshed ICP Terms of Reference.” 2.

The Leader of the Labour Group, Mr Brady, thanked and paid tribute to the previous Leader of the Labour Group, Dr Sullivan. 9. Mr Brady commented that his party supported the Financial Hardship Programme as an initiative which benefitted Kent’s residents and businesses. 10. Mr Brady referred to the topic of housing and stated that his party awaited the deliverance of Framing Kent’s Future first pledges in relation to infrastructure and welcomed the new Labour government taking the lead on Infrastructure First. 11. Mr Brady acknowledged the results of the general election and welcomed the 11 Labour MPs throughout Kent. 12. In reference to the King’s Speech, Mr Brady highlighted and endorsed the new government’s proposed bills including those related to budget responsibility, support for Kent workers, new powers to deal with anti-social behaviour, public transport and railway reform, water quality, education and apprenticeships, mental health support, child poverty and wellbeing, and trade and investment with the EU. 13. Mr Lehmann, Leader of the Green and Independents Group, acknowledged the results of the recent general election and confirmed that the Green Party had received over 1.8 million votes nationally and the 4 MPs would represent nearly half a million voters each in the House of Commons. 14. Mr Lehmann explained that the global increase in temperature had made May and June 2024 the hottest ever recorded. The past 13 consecutive months were the hottest recorded for the respective time of year, with an estimated 95% chance 2024 would be the hottest year on record. He suggested that the climate crisis had not been given enough prominence during previous Full Council meetings. He said that multiyear settlements were a good start and hoped the new government would be able to provide both financial and policy support in relation to the growing climate crisis. 15. In relation to the King’s speech, he referred to several proposals including bringing rail services back into public ownership and the bill to ban conversion therapy. 16. In relation to the devolution of powers, Mr Lehmann confirmed that his group opposed the idea of concentrated decision-making power into a single representative and noted with concern that Labour adopted the outgoing government’s position in relation to directly elected mayors. 17. Mr Lehmann voiced some concerns relating to the proposed planning reforms but confirmed that he was in support of the rapid lifting of the de facto ban on new onshore wind farms. 18. Mr Lehmann closed by confirming his relief that the planned London resort project had ceased. He commented that the project would have impacted the biodiversity and insect life of north Kent as well as creating a strain on the local road network. He thanked the Save Swanscombe Peninsula Campaign for their work over many years in protecting the land. 19. Mr Streatfeild on behalf of the Liberal Democrats Group acknowledged the general election results and welcomed the first Liberal Democrat MP in Kent. 20. In relation to the King’s speech, Mr Streatfeild stated that he felt the NHS should be at the heart of the reforms with a legal right to be seen by a GP within one week. On the topic of devolution, he confirmed that his party did not share the Labour views for a Metro Mayor but did have the same enthusiasm for devolution. 21. Mr Streatfeild referred to Unaccompanied Asylum Seeking Children (UASC) and the National Transfer Scheme and questioned whether the new government would require local authorities to look after children who arrived in Kent, or instead, set up a national child refugee agency to meet the national responsibility. 22. Mr Streatfeild highlighted the current consultation on SEND specialist schools and the views submitted by headteachers that contrasted with the Council’s position. 23. Mr Streatfeild referred to the Household Support Fund and said that he hoped the government would take the Liberal Democrat view on Adult Social Care and commented on the Council’s ASCH Charging Policy which now took into account the higher rate of Disability Living Allowance (DLA), Personal Independent Payment (PIP) and Attendance Allowance (AA) when calculating the cost of care and support. 24. Mr Gough responded to the points raised about Infrastructure First and commented that work was carried out within the constraints of a national system, particularly in relation to developer contributions when it came to building school capacity. 25. In response to the point made about devolution, the Leader commented that the new administration was building on a previous levelling up white paper, although with some differences for example in relation to a less prescriptive approach to mayors. 26. In response to comments regarding climate change, the Leader stated that the Council sought to discharge the responsibilities within its remit. He highlighted that the reduction of greenhouse gasses from the Council’s estate and operations, the local nature recovery strategy ‘Making Space for Nature’, and mitigation around flooding, demonstrated the administration’s awareness to the consequences of climate change. 27. The Leader identified that, from the comments made, there was common ground in relation to concerns surrounding planning changes. 28. In response to comments made about buses, the Leader said that whilst there was a range of options, funding was the key issue. He referred to the use of the Bus Service Improvement Plan (BSIP) to secure school transport. 29. In response to the point raised about SEND, the Leader commented that the approach taken in this area should be evidence based and was linked to a wider systemic issue. He referred to the programme the Council had undertaken in relation to significant change within SEND and highlighted the challenges in the current framework that needed to be addressed nationally to provide an affordable outcome for services for children and families. 30.
